		</li>

			<small>moreover several software like CI/CD tools relying on it,<br/>
				so experience with it is really appreciated in a curriculum</small></li>
		<li class="fragment">Project's edits are tracked <i>(and signed)</i><br/>
			<small>you can blame who did the mistake</small></li>
		<li class="fragment">...also these slides are versioned with
