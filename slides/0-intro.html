	<h3>Before we start, let us see some common scenarios we might be dealing with</h3>
</section>
<section>
	<h3>Merging</h3>

	<p>Jessica and Susan are working on a project, they use a Dropbox folder to share files</p>
	<p class="fragment">Jessica finishes developing her part of the project, all works well on her machine, so she merges
		her files with the ones in the shared folder</p>
	<h4 class="fragment">Everything stops working</h4>

	<h3>Versioning for fallback</h3>

	<p>Matthew has been writing his thesis for 4 months</p>
	<p class="fragment">He is really upset because one week ago his rapporteur told him to remove the part on the
		chocolate donuts, on which he worked hard for two entire weeks. He deleted it and since then he is working on a
		new theme</p>
	<h4 class="fragment">Now, the rapporteur calls him and it tells that he changed his mind, that he should put the donuts back üç©</h4>

	<h3>Offline working</h3>

	<p>Mark is a really trained developer, he knows that storing a project on his machine is the first step to lose it</p>
	<p class="fragment">So, he puts his project on a renowned hosting service that snapshots data daily</p>
	<p class="fragment">Mark has to deliver a project tomorrow,<br/>but today he has to take an 8 hours trip</p>
	<p class="fragment">No worries, he will to work on the train</p>
	<h4 class="fragment">Because of there is no connection in the train,<br/>he doesn't have access to the project files ü•≥</h4>

	<h3>Samanta</h3>

	<p class="fragment">Samanta works frequently with other monkeys on several projects</p>
	<p class="fragment">She often has to deal with <b>merging</b> issues,<br/>but she always gets out of them as a winner</p>
	<p class="fragment">Her commissioners are always undecided,<br/>but she <b>never lost</b> a feature she previously
		worked on</p>
	<p class="fragment"><b>Lack of connectivity</b> never slowed down her work</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h4>Samanta does not have <b>superpowers</b>...</h4>
	<h4 class="fragment">...not like a Thor or a Doctor Strange...</h4>
	<h4 class="fragment">...she, like an Iron Man, relaying on a <b>super tool</b>...</h4>
	<div class="fragment">
		<h4>...namely</h4>

	<h2>Others motivations to know<br/>how to deal with git</h2>

	<ul>
		<li class="fragment">Open source is moving forward thanks to <b>git</b><br/>
			<small>if you want to join it, you need to know <b>git</b> (<a href="https://gitlab.com">GitLab</a>, <a
					href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>)</small>
		</li>
		<li class="fragment"><b>git</b> is an industrial standard<br/>
			<small>several software platforms such as CI/CD tools rely on it,<br/>
				so a good knowledge is very appreciated in a curriculum</small></li>
		<li class="fragment">Project edits are tracked <i>(and optionally signed)</i><br/>
			<small>you can blame who made the mistake</small></li>
		<li class="fragment">...these slides too are versioned with
			<a href="https://gitlab.poul.org/corsi/git/intro"><b>git</b></a></li>
