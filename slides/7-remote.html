    <h3>How can i make my commits available<br/>to anybody else?</h3>

    <p class="fragment">Even if possible, the direct synchronization between<br/>

    <h3>Tries... and if there is a conflict?</h3>

    <p>Also for a conflict during a <b>push</b> operation we have to be us to handle the conflict</p>

    <p class="fragment">We have to do a <b>pull</b> operation,<br/>
        solve the conflicts and then do again the <b>push</b> operation.</p>

    <small class="fragment">As a best practices, do a <b>pull</b> operation ever before resuming to work over a project.</small>
