	<h3>How can i make my commits available<br/>to anybody else?</h3>

	<p class="fragment">Even if possible, the direct synchronization between<br/>
		two personal computers is not generally used</p>
	<p class="fragment">Usually we rely on one or more hosting of repositories to be common nodes among personal
		computers</p>

	<p>What has changed?</p>

	<pre class="fragment"><code class="lang-sh">origin  https&colon;//gitlab.org/path/repository.git (fetch)
origin  https&colon;//gitlab.org/path/repository.git (push)</code></pre>

	<p class="fragment">Two references to a remote repository<br/>
		(which I called "origin") were created,<br/>
		one to send commits (push)<br/>
		and one to receive commits (fetch) </p>

	<h3>How to "update" a remote repository?</h3>

	<h3 class="fragment">Push</h3>

	<pre class="fragment"><code class="lang-bash input">git push origin master</code></pre>

	<p class="fragment">git sends the commits of the <i>master</i><br/>
		to the remote repository called <i>origin</i>,<br/>
		which tries to merge them to its repository's history.</p>

	<h3>And what if we want to download<br/>
		the remote commits?</h3>

	<h3 class="fragment">Pull</h3>

	<pre class="fragment"><code class="lang-bash input">git pull origin master</code></pre>

	<p class="fragment">git tries to download the commits of branch <i>master</i><br/>
		from the remote repository called <i>origin</i>,<br/>
		and it merges them with the local history.</p>

	<h3>It tries... and what if is there a conflict?</h3>

	<p class="fragment">Guess what...</p>
	<b class="fragment" style="color: red;">...we have to correct it by ourselves!</b>

	<p class="fragment">In a way very similar to how we have seen<br/>
		in the <a href="#/7/11/">branch</a> section.</p>

	<h3>It tries... and what if is there a conflict?</h3>

	<p>Also for a conflict during a <b>push</b> operation<br/>
		we have to manually handle the conflict</p>

	<h3>Conflicts must always be resolved<br/>
		by the client-side!</h3>

	<p class="fragment">We have to do a <b>pull</b> operation,<br/>
		solve the conflicts and then do again the <b>push</b> operation.</p>

	<small class="fragment">As a best practice, do a <b>pull</b> operation ever before resuming to work over a project.</small>
